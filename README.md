# Sign-Language-Recognition
# Housing Prediction

In the following Github I have uploaded two separate projects.

The first project is a Sign Language Recognition project where I used a Deep Neural Network learning system. I was able to reach a 87% 
accruacy, however I could not extend the project and evaluate it due to my limited knowledge of machine learning in Python.

The second project is a Housing Price Prediction project where I used Linear Regression to evaluate the system. I was able to reach a
91% accuracy, again I could not further evaluate the project due to my limted knowledge.
